RPC - (Remote Procedure call) Communicate with other windows machines in the network and take complete control of them. White hat hackers thought to close TCP 139 and 445 which would deny any communication to a windows network. Wasn’t practical because printers, fax machines etc still needed to connect. DGA - (Domain Generation algorithm) Malware will constantly generate calculated domain names --some that won’t even exist yet. Some time in the future, the author will register the domain and all the infected machines will go to it.<p>Bots operate on one (could have 2 or 3 as back ups) ip address --called “command and control”. If that is killed or malware doesn’t have it, they will rely on DGA and go to remote server.<hr><p>Benefits of snapshots<ul><li>Helps step through analyzing malware (starting and stopping when needed).<li>Able to save a place in the virtual machine that you may want to come back to in the future in case you break something.</ul><p>One tactic after finding the IOC is to identify where it’s being hosted and request a blocker to be put on the ip by the webhosting company.<p>This can also be a tactic for <strong>Sinkholing</strong> a Domain: redirect all traffic to our machine so we can get a list of infected nodes.<p>Domain registrar can also reset the password to account and take away all DNS settings.<p><strong>Review</strong><p>An argument for running malware in normal mode is that you can see if it is persistent unlike immutable mode that would not show you if the malware was persistent.<p>TrickBot - banking trojan Kelihost - pishing email sent out during christmas.
