Some examples include Speech Recognition, Biomedical Data, Linguistics, Auto-complete, Auto-correct etc. If we break up the words contained within NLP, we have a better understanding of what it means. Natrual languages are English, Spanish, Italian, French, German and so on. Processing just means some work on some input (in this case, a computer that receivees speech and text) to result in some useful output (classifier, words, speech etc.).<h3 id=nlp-pipeline>NLP Pipeline</h3><p>There are a few topics that encompass the study of NLP. You may start at any one of these and work up/down the pipeline. They generally start and continue as follows:<ul><li>Phonetics: Study of Human speech/sound.<li>Phonology: Mental processing of sounds.<li>Morphology: Internal structure of words.<li>Syntax: Rules for how words are put together in a language.<li>Semantics: Meaning behind word(s).<li>Pragmatics: Understanding text in its entire context (who/what/where/when).</ul><h3 id=common-terms>Common Terms</h3><p>Here are some explained terms that you might come accross:<ul><li><strong>Corpus</strong> (plural corpora) - Collection of documents.<li><strong>Lemma</strong> - Also known as stem, it is the root of a word (i.e. run has the same lemma as running).<li><strong>Affix</strong> - Part of a word that gives grammatical function; could be prefix, suffix, infix & circumfix.<li><strong>Morpheme</strong> - Smallest meaningful units of a word; containes stems and affixes.<li><strong>Stemming</strong> - Process of removing affixes crudely (am, is, are -> be).<li><strong>Lemmatization</strong> - Process of removing affixes based off the morphological analysis of a word.<li><strong>Tokenization</strong> - Separation of words using regex and/or Machine Learning classifiers.<li><strong>Segmentation</strong> - Normally, this is the separation of sentences in a corpus.<li><strong>Language Model</strong> - Historically, it is a probability distribution of a sequence of words.</ul><h2 id=text-normalization>Text Normalization</h2><p>TODO</main><footer><div><p>Built with the help of <a href=https://www.getzola.org target=_blank>Zola</a></div></footer></article>
