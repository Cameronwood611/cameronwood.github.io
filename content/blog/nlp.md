 ## Background

 Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used in many fields. Some examples include Speech Recognition, Biomedical Data, Linguistics, Auto-complete, Auto-correct etc. If we break up the words contained within NLP, we have a better understanding of what it means. Natrual languages are English, Spanish, Italian, French, German and so on. Processing just means some work on some input (in this case, a computer that receivees speech and text) to result in some useful output (classifier, words, speech etc.).

 ### NLP Pipeline

 There are a few topics that encompass the study of NLP. You may start at any one of these and work up/down the pipeline. They generally start and continue as follows:

  - Phonetics: Study of Human speech/sound.
  - Phonology: Mental processing of sounds.
  - Morphology: Internal structure of words.
  - Syntax: Rules for how words are put together in a language.
  - Semantics: Meaning behind word(s).
  - Pragmatics: Understanding text in its entire context (who/what/where/when).

 ### Common Terms

 Here are some explained terms that you might come accross:

  + __Corpus__ (plural corpora) - Collection of documents.  
  + __Lemma__ - Also known as stem, it is the root of a word (i.e. run has the same lemma as running).  
  + __Affix__ - Part of a word that gives grammatical function; could be prefix, suffix, infix & circumfix.  
  + __Morpheme__ - Smallest meaningful units of a word; containes stems and affixes.  
  + __Stemming__ - Process of removing affixes crudely (am, is, are -> be).  
  + __Lemmatization__ - Process of removing affixes based off the morphological analysis of a word.  
  + __Tokenization__ - Separation of words using regex and/or Machine Learning classifiers.  
  + __Segmentation__ - Normally, this is the separation of sentences in a corpus.  
  + __Language Model__ - Historically, it is a probability distribution of a sequence of words.
