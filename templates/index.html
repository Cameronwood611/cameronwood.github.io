<h1>Cameron Wood's Website</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to my personal website!</p>
  
<p>You'll find my personal projects below (unfortunately I can't upload my code 
  from work!) and interesting topics on my "blog" page. Feel free to reference 
my github, gitlab and email with the links at the top right of this page.</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>My name is Cameron Wood and I have a passion for learning and creating.</p>
  
<p>Currently, I work in a Computer Forensics research laboratory (CFRL) at the University of 
  Alabama at Birmingham as a software engineer. I've been a professional developer for about 
  four years now and hold a BSc degree in Computer Science. I've recently been hired through 
  CFRL as a Graduate Research Assistant to build a standalone product while receiving a Masters 
  in Computer Science.
</p>

<p>A passion of mine is teaching so I'm also a teaching assisstant for the professors here 
  at UAB!
</p>

<p>My life outside of school/work involves carpentry, playing soccer and meeting new people.</p>
