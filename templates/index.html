<h1>Cameron Wood's Website</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to my personal website!</p>
  
<p>Below are some of my personal projects that I've accumulated over the years. Additionally, 
  I will sometimes post interesting topics on my "blog" page. Feel free to reference 
my github, gitlab and email with the icons at the top right of this page.</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>My name is Cameron Wood and I have a passion for learning and creating.</p>
  
<p>Currently, I work as an artificial intelligence and machine learning engineer. I previously 
  worked as a software engineer but found passion in pursuing a computer vision related career. I'm currently 
  located in Birmingham, AL and would love to connect with anyone interested in similar topics!
</p>

<p>My life outside of work involves wood working, playing soccer and developing technical skills.</p>
