    Welcome to my Blog. Here, I'll mostly post about what I learn from the courses at my University 
    (at least, the ones I really care about). This will mainly serve as a reminder for myself, but it could 
    also be helpful for anyone else interested in the subject. I plan to keep these very high level.
